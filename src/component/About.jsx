I am a Frontend React Developer with 1.6 years of experience. I am proficient in React, Redux, Redux-Saga, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. I can create beautiful front ends using CSS. I have developed a ChatApp and an e-commerce clone on my own. I am self-taught and have a strong passion for learning new things. I am currently working at Sambodhi Research and Communications, a product-based company.

I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual with a strong work ethic. I am also a team player and enjoy working with others to achieve common goals. I am confident that I can make a significant contribution to your team.
